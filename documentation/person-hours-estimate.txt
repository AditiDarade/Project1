Team meetings:
	1-2 each week (~1 hour each week)
		3 weeks * 1 hour * 5 people = 15 hours
		
Coding:
	Roughly 2-4 hours each week per person (Smaller scale projects in previous classes tend to have taken around 5-7 hours, which led us to this estimate)
		3 hours * 2 weeks * 5 people = 30 hours 
		
Testing: 
	~1 hour for each person after implementation is completed
		1 hour * 5 people = 5 hours
		
Documenting:
	~1 hour for each person to document throughout the project
		1 hour * 5 people = 5 hours 

Total Estimate: 15 hours (Team meetings) + 30 hours (Coding) + 5 hours (Testing) + 5 hours (Documenting) = 55 hours
